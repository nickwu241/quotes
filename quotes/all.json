The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colors seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.", "author": "Unknown", "tag": "bob-marley-quotes"}, {"quote": "Overcome the devils with a thing called love.", "author": "Unknown", "tag": "bob-marley-quotes"}, {"quote": "She may not be the most popular or prettiest but if you love her and she makes you smile… what else matters?", "author": "Unknown", "tag": "bob-marley-quotes"}, {"quote": "The biggest coward of a man is to awaken the love of a woman without the intention of loving her.", "author": "Unknown", "tag": "bob-marley-quotes"}, {"quote": "The trust is, everyone is going to hurt you.
